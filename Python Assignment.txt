Module 7) DA - Introduction to Python Assignment

1) What are the types of Applications?
Answer:- 1. Web Applications: These applications run within web browsers and are accessible over the internet. Examples include email clients, 		                      social media platforms, and online shopping websites. 
	2. Mobile Applications: Designed specifically for smartphones and tablets, mobile apps offer a more tailored experience on these devices. 	                        Examples include social media apps, games, and navigation apps. 
	3. Desktop Applications: These applications are installed and run directly on a computer's operating system. Examples include word 	    	                          processors, spreadsheet software, and image editors. 


2) What is programing?
Answer:- Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a specific task or solve a problem. It 	 involves writing code in a programming language, which is a set of rules and syntax that allows humans to communicate with computers.


3) What is Python?
Answer:- Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and ease of use.It was created by Guido Van Rossum and 	 first released in 1991


4) Write a Python program to check if a number is positive, negative or zero.
Answer:- number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
         if num > 0:
              print("positive number")
         elif num < 0:
              print("Negative number")
         else:
              print("Zero")


5)Write a Python program to get the Factorial number of given numbers.
Answer:- n = 6
	fact = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            fact *= i
        print(fact)


6)How memory is managed in Python?
Answer:- Python's memory management is handled automatically using a private heap and a combination of techniques including reference counting and 	 garbage collection. 


7)What is the purpose continuing statement in python?
Answer:- The purpose of the continue statement in Python is to skip the remaining code within the current iteration of a loop and immediately                                	 proceed to the next iteration. 


8) Write a Python program to find whether a given number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
Answer:- num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is an Even number.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is an Odd number.")


9) Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string 
Answer:-  for char in set(s):
             print(char, ":", s.count(char))


10) Differentiate between append () and extend () methods?
Answer: list = [1, 2, 3]
        list.append([4, 5])
        print("After append:", list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]
        list.extend([6, 7])
        print("After extend:", list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5], 6, 7]


11)Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]? 
Answer: list1 = [2, 33, 222, 14, 25]
        print(list1[-1])
        # Output: [25]


12) How will you remove last object from a list?
Answer: list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        last_item = list.pop()
        print(list)  
        # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
        print(last_item) 
        # Output: 5  (the removed item)


13) What is List? How will you reverse a list?
Answer:- A list is an ordered collection of items (elements) which can be of different types (numbers, strings, objects, etc.).
	 Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after creation.
	 Lists are defined using square brackets [], with elements separated by commas.
	1. Using the .reverse() method (in-place):
            my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
            my_list.reverse()
            print(my_list)  # Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]


14)What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.
Answer:- A tuple is a collection of items that is:
	Ordered (items have a fixed position)
	Unchangeable (you canâ€™t change items after creating it
